# 🛠️ dotfiles

Welcome to my `dotfiles` repository — a curated collection of personal configuration files for a beautiful and efficient terminal experience.

These dotfiles power my development setup with customized themes, tooling, and workflow enhancements. If you're into fast terminals, minimal config, and modern replacements for traditional Unix tools — this is for you.
